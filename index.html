          <p>
            I am a technical communicator and educator who enjoys making complex ideas clear, designing student-centered learning experiences, and supporting diverse learners in academic and professional settings. My current work focuses on technical communication, user experience, and higher education. At Missouri S&T, I am completing a thesis on the rhetorical framing of artificial intelligence, examining how Microsoft Copilot’s marketing communicates “responsible AI,” trust, and usability for different audiences.
          </p>
          <p>
           I bring a cross-disciplinary background that helps me connect rhetoric, design, and technology in ways that improve communication for real users. I’m especially interested in how institutions and organizations use language, visuals, and digital platforms to shape understanding and guide decision-making. Through teaching, research, and design work, I aim to create communication practices that are clear, ethical, and accessible to a wide range of audiences.
